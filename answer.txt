Answer These Questions
Once you have successfully run a simulation, use your python skills to analyze the simulation results:

What were the inputs you gave the simulation? (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate, reproductive rate)
Poulation Size: 300
Percent Vaccinated: 0.7
Virus Name: Covid
mortality rate: 0.1
reproductive rate: 0.25
People Initially Infected: 15

What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?
About 30% of the population became infected before the virus burnt out.

What percentage of the population died from the virus?
about 15% of the population died from the virus

Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many times, in total, did a vaccination save someone from potentially becoming infected?
When a person was vaccinated, they did not die from the virus because of how I coded my simulation.
